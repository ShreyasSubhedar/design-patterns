# Design Patterns
## Definition
> In software engineering, a **design pattern** is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

## Why we use design patterns?
- Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. 
- Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems and improves code readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns.
- Design patterns provide general solutions, documented in a format that doesn't require specifics tied to a particular problem.
- Design patterns **allow developers to communicate using well-known**, well-understood names for software interactions. Common design patterns can be improved over time, making them more robust than ad-hoc designs
- **Ace the interviews ;-)**

## Design Patterns and its types
- Design Patterns are mainly distributed into 3 different types.
  - ```Creational```
  - ```Behavioral```
  - ```Structural```
  
  ### Creational Design Patterns
  - For now, the creational design patterns are all about class instantiation and differnt ways to create objects
  ### Structional Design Patterns
  - Structural design patterns mainly focus on the relationship b/w the objects
  ### Behavioural Design Patterns
  - behavioural design patterns are all about interaction / communication between these objects
